      Hi, I'm Abylay Mukhit.
      
      - I like to play and create small indie games.

      - On this page you will find more about the development process of past games 
      like [STYX](https://apps.apple.com/kz/app/styx-vertical-platformer/id1587424131) and 
      [HPB](https://apps.apple.com/kz/app/hyper-pixel-beast/id1503065407),
      and also about future projects. Now I work with small team of friends to make games for mobile and PC.
      You can support our team by buying our games, watching our channel, and following us on social media. 
      
      - Hope to see you around!
